    <h2>How to get a girl in five steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>You get near the object, discreatly, as if you are not even noticing her/it</li>
        <li>You take your zarabatana out of your pocket and point it over her neck, and then put a long breath in it</li>
        <li>You take her into your arms as if she/it had had just passed out and like you're the saver (Dont forget to discreatly take of the sedative dart)</li>
        <li start="4">Now you kiss her before she wakes up while shes in your arms and pretend like her eyes are closed for an action of passion</li>
        <li>The last step is to let her sleeping all by her self at a public bench, like in a metro, and go away forever (you just got your first kiss)</li>
    </ol>
